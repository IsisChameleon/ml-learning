Modularity is a scale value between −0.5 (non-modular clustering) and 1 (fully modular clustering) that measures the relative density of edges inside communities with respect to edges outside communities. Optimizing this value theoretically results in the best possible grouping of the nodes of a given network. But because going through all possible iterations of the nodes into groups is impractical, heuristic algorithms are used.\\nIn the Louvain Method of community detection, first small communities are found by optimizing modularity locally on all nodes, then each small community is grouped into one node and the first step is repeated. The method is similar to the earlier method by Clauset, Newman and Moore that connects communities whose amalgamation produces the largest increase in modularity.\\n\\n\\n== Algorithm ==\\nThe value to be optimized is modularity, defined as a value in the range \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        [\\n        −\\n        1\\n        \\n          /\\n        \\n        2\\n        ,\\n        1\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle [-1/2,1]}\\n   that measures the density of links inside communities compared to links between communities.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1836, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None),\n",

This is highly unrealistic in many real-world applications. For example, in social networks, most people belong to multiple communities: their family, their friends, their co-workers, old school buddies, etc. In biological networks, most genes or proteins belong to more than one pathway or complex. Furthermore, Louvain has been shown to sometimes produce arbitrarily badly connected communities, and has been effectively superseded (at least in the non-overlapping case) by the Leiden algorithm.\\n\\n\\n== Comparison to other methods of non-overlapping community detection ==\\nWhen comparing modularity optimization methods, the two measures of importance are the speed and the resulting modularity value. A higher speed is better as it shows a method is more efficient than others and a higher modularity value is desirable as it points to having better-defined communities.\\nThe compared methods are, the algorithm of Clauset, Newman, and Moore, Pons and Latapy, and Wakita and Tsurumi.\\n-/- in the table refers to a method that took over 24hrs to run.

Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules. Modularity is often used in optimization methods for detecting community structure in networks.  Biological networks, including animal brains, exhibit a high degree of modularity. However, modularity maximization is not statistically consistent, and finds communities in its own null model, i.e. fully random graphs, and therefore it cannot be used to find statistically significant community structures in empirical networks. Furthermore, it has been shown that modularity suffers a resolution limit and, therefore, it is unable to detect small communities.\\n\\n\\n== Motivation ==\\nMany scientifically important problems can be represented and empirically studied using networks. For example, biological and social patterns, the World Wide Web, metabolic networks, food webs, neural networks and pathological networks are real world problems that can be mathematically represented and topologically studied to reveal some unexpected structural features. Most of these networks possess a certain community structure that has substantial importance in building an understanding regarding the dynamics of the network. For instance, a closely connected social community will imply a faster rate of transmission of information or rumor among them than a loosely connected community. Thus, if a network is represented by a number of individual nodes connected by links which signify a certain degree of interaction between the nodes, communities are defined as groups of densely interconnected nodes that are only sparsely connected with the rest of the network. Hence, it may be imperative to identify the communities in networks since the communities may have quite different properties such as node degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness, centrality, etc., from that of the average network. Modularity is one such measure, which when maximized, leads to the appearance of communities in a given network.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2222, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None),\n",

In the most common version of the concept, the randomization of the edges is done so as to preserve the degree of each vertex. Consider a graph with \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        n\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle n}\\n   nodes and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        m\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle m}\\n   links (edges) such that the graph can be partitioned into two communities using a membership variable \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        s\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle s}\\n  . If a node \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   belongs to community 1, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          s\\n          \\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle s_{v}=1}\\n  , or if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   belongs to community 2, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          s\\n          \\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        −\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle s_{v}=-1}\\n  . Let the adjacency matrix for the network be represented by \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        A\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A}\\n  , where \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            v\\n            w\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{vw}=0}\\n   means there's no edge (no interaction) between nodes \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        w\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle w}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            v\\n            w\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{vw}=1}\\n   means there is an edge between the two. Also for simplicity we consider an undirected network. Thus \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            v\\n            w\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            w\\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{vw}=A_{wv}}\\n  . (It is important to note that multiple edges may exist between two nodes, but here we assess the simplest case).\\nModularity \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Q\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle Q}\\n   is then defined as the fraction of edges that fall within group 1 or 2, minus the expected number of edges within groups 1 and 2 for a random graph with the same node degree distribution as the given network.\\nThe expected number of edges shall be computed using the concept of a configuration model. The configuration model is a randomized realization of a particular network. Given a network with \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        n\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle n}\\n   nodes, where each node \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   has a node degree \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{v}}\\n  , the configuration model cuts each edge into two halves,  and then each half edge, called a stub, is rewired randomly with any other stub in the network, even allowing self-loops (which occur when a stub is rewired to another stub from the same node) and multiple-edges between the same two nodes. Thus, even though the node degree distribution of the graph remains intact, the configuration model results in a completely random network.\\n\\n\\n== Expected Number of Edges Between Nodes ==\\nNow consider two nodes \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        w\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle w}\\n  , with node degrees \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{v}}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            w\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{w}}\\n   respectively, from a randomly rewired network as described above.

The general form of the modularity for arbitrary numbers of communities is equivalent to a Potts spin glass and similar algorithms can be developed for this case also.\\n\\n\\n== Overfitting ==\\nAlthough the method of modularity maximization is motivated by computing a deviation from a null model, this deviation is not computed in a statistically consistent manner. Because of this, the method notoriously finds high-scoring communities in its own null model\\n\\n(the configuration model), which by definition cannot be statistically significant. Because of this, the method cannot be used to reliably obtain statistically significant community structure in empirical networks.\\n\\n\\n== Resolution limit ==\\nModularity compares the number of edges inside a cluster with the expected number of edges that\\none would find in the cluster if the network were a random network with the same number of nodes and where\\neach node keeps its degree, but edges are otherwise randomly attached. This random null model implicitly assumes that each node can get attached to any other node of the network. This assumption is however unreasonable if the network is very large, as the horizon of a node includes a small part of the network, ignoring most of it.\\nMoreover, this implies that the expected number of edges between two groups of nodes decreases if the size of the network increases. So, if a network is large enough, the expected number of edges between two groups of nodes in modularity's null model may be smaller than one. If this happens, a single edge between the two clusters would be interpreted by modularity as a sign of a strong correlation between the two clusters, and optimizing modularity would lead to the merging of the two clusters, independently of the clusters' features. So, even weakly interconnected complete graphs, which have the highest possible density of internal edges, and represent the best identifiable communities, would be merged by modularity optimization if the network were sufficiently large.\\nFor this reason, optimizing modularity in large networks would fail to resolve small communities, even when they are well defined. This bias\\nis inevitable for methods like modularity optimization, which rely on a global null model.\\n\\n\\n== Multiresolution methods ==\\nThere are two main approaches which try to solve the resolution limit within the modularity context: the addition of a resistance r to every node, in the form of a self-loop, which increases (r>0) or decreases (r<0) the aversion of nodes to form communities; or the addition of a parameter γ>0 in front of the null-case term in the definition of modularity, which controls the relative importance between internal links of the communities and the null model. Optimizing modularity for values of these parameters in their respective appropriate ranges, it is possible to recover the whole mesoscale of the network, from the macroscale in which all nodes belong to the same community, to the microscale in which every node forms its own community, hence the name multiresolution methods. However, it has been shown that these methods have limitations when communities are very heterogeneous in size.\", start_char_idx=21417, end_char_idx=26516, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None),\n",

In the particular case of non-overlapping community finding, this implies that the network divides naturally into groups of nodes with dense connections internally and sparser connections between groups.  But overlapping communities are also allowed. The more general definition is based on the principle that pairs of nodes are more likely to be connected if they are both members of the same community(ies), and less likely to be connected if they do not share communities. A related but different problem is community search, where the goal is to find a community that a certain vertex belongs to.\\n\\n\\n== Properties ==\\nIn the study of networks, such as computer and information networks, social networks and biological networks, a number of different characteristics have been found to occur commonly, including the small-world property, heavy-tailed degree distributions, and clustering, among others. Another common characteristic is community structure.\\nIn the context of networks, community structure refers to the occurrence of groups of nodes in a network that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network, as shown in the example image to the right.  This inhomogeneity of connections suggests that the network has certain natural divisions within it.\\nCommunities are often defined in terms of the partition of the set of vertices, that is each node is put into one and only one community, just as in the figure. This is a useful simplification and most community detection methods find this type of community structure. However, in some cases a better representation could be one where vertices are in more than one community.  This might happen in a social network where each vertex represents a person, and the communities represent the different groups of friends: one community for family, another community for co-workers, one for friends in the same sports club, and so on. The use of cliques for community detection discussed below is just one example of how such overlapping community structure can be found.\\nSome networks may not have any meaningful community structure.  Many basic network models, for example, such as the random graph and the Barabási–Albert model, do not display community structure.\\n\\n\\n== Importance ==\\nCommunity structures are quite common in real networks. Social networks include community groups (the origin of the term, in fact) based on common location, interests, occupation, etc.Finding an underlying community structure in a network, if it exists, is important for a number of reasons. Communities allow us to create a large scale map of a network since individual communities act like meta-nodes in the network which makes its study easier.Individual communities also shed light on the function of the system represented by the network since communities often correspond to functional units of the system. In metabolic networks, such functional groups correspond to cycles or pathways whereas in the protein interaction network, communities correspond to proteins with similar functionality inside a biological cell. Similarly, citation networks form communities by research topic. Being able to identify these sub-structures within a network can provide insight into how network function and topology affect each other. Such insight can be useful in improving some algorithms on graphs such as spectral clustering.Importantly, communities often have very different properties than the average properties of the networks. Thus, only concentrating on the average properties usually misses many important and interesting features inside the networks. For example, in a given social network, both gregarious and reticent groups might exists simultaneously.Existence of communities also generally affects various processes like rumour spreading or epidemic spreading happening on a network. Hence to properly understand such processes, it is important to detect communities and also to study how they affect the spreading processes in various settings.\\nFinally, an important application that community detection has found in network science is the prediction of missing links and the identification of false links in the network. During the measurement process, some links may not get observed for a number of reasons. Similarly, some links could falsely enter into the data because of the errors in the measurement. Both these cases are well handled by community detection algorithm since it allows one to assign the probability of existence of an edge between a given pair of nodes.\\n\\n\\n== Algorithms for finding communities ==\\nFinding communities within an arbitrary network can be a computationally difficult task.  The number of communities, if any, within the network is typically unknown and the communities are often of unequal size and/or density.  Despite these difficulties, however, several methods for community finding have been developed and employed with varying levels of success.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5202, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None),\n",

The number of communities, if any, within the network is typically unknown and the communities are often of unequal size and/or density.  Despite these difficulties, however, several methods for community finding have been developed and employed with varying levels of success.\\n\\n\\n=== Minimum-cut method ===\\nOne of the oldest algorithms for dividing networks into parts is the minimum cut method (and variants such as ratio cut and normalized cut).  This method sees use, for example, in load balancing for parallel computing in order to minimize communication between processor nodes.\\nIn the minimum-cut method, the network is divided into a predetermined number of parts, usually of approximately the same size, chosen such that the number of edges between groups is minimized.  The method works well in many of the applications for which it was originally intended but is less than ideal for finding community structure in general networks since it will find communities regardless of whether they are implicit in the structure, and it will find only a fixed number of them.\\n\\n\\n=== Hierarchical clustering ===\\nAnother method for finding community structures in networks is hierarchical clustering.  In this method one defines a similarity measure quantifying some (usually topological) type of similarity between node pairs.  Commonly used measures include the cosine similarity, the Jaccard index, and the Hamming distance between rows of the adjacency matrix.  Then one groups similar nodes into communities according to this measure.  There are several common schemes for performing the grouping, the two simplest being single-linkage clustering, in which two groups are considered separate communities if and only if all pairs of nodes in different groups have similarity lower than a given threshold, and complete linkage clustering, in which all nodes within every group have similarity greater than a threshold. An important step is how to determine the threshold to stop the agglomerative clustering, indicating a near-to-optimal community structure. A common strategy consist to build one or several metrics monitoring global properties of the network, which peak at given step of the clustering. An interesting approach in this direction is the use of various similarity or dissimilarity measures, combined through convex sums,. Another approximation is the computation of a quantity monitoring the density of edges within clusters with respect to the density between clusters, such as the partition density, which has been proposed when the similarity metric is defined between edges (which permits the definition of overlapping communities), and extended when the similarity is defined between nodes, which allows to consider alternative definitions of communities such as guilds (i.e. groups of nodes sharing a similar number of links with respect to the same neighbours but not necessarily connected themselves). These methods can be extended to consider multidimensional networks, for instance when we are dealing with networks having nodes with different types of links.\\n\\n\\n=== Girvan–Newman algorithm ===\\nAnother commonly used algorithm for finding communities is the Girvan–Newman algorithm.  This algorithm identifies edges in a network that lie between communities and then removes them, leaving behind just the communities themselves.  The identification is performed by employing the graph-theoretic measure betweenness centrality, which assigns a number to each edge which is large if the edge lies \"between\" many pairs of nodes.\\nThe Girvan–Newman algorithm returns results of reasonable quality and is popular because it has been implemented in a number of standard software packages.  But it also runs slowly, taking time O(m2n) on a network of n vertices and m edges, making it impractical for networks of more than a few thousand nodes.\\n\\n\\n=== Modularity maximization ===\\nIn spite of its known drawbacks, one of the most widely used methods for community detection is modularity maximization.  Modularity is a benefit function that measures the quality of a particular division of a network into communities.  The modularity maximization method detects communities by searching over possible divisions of a network for one or more that have particularly high modularity.  Since exhaustive search over all possible divisions is usually intractable, practical algorithms are based on approximate optimization methods such as greedy algorithms, simulated annealing, or spectral optimization, with different approaches offering different balances between speed and accuracy.\\nA popular modularity maximization approach is the Louvain method, which iteratively optimizes local communities until global modularity can no longer be improved given perturbations to the current community state.\\nAn algorithm that utilizes the RenEEL scheme, which is an example of the Extremal Ensemble Learning (EEL) paradigm, is currently the best modularity maximizing algorithm.The usefulness of modularity optimization is questionable, as it has been shown that modularity optimization often fails to detect clusters smaller than some scale, depending on the size of the network (resolution limit); on the other hand the landscape of modularity values is characterized by a huge degeneracy of partitions with high modularity, close to the absolute maximum, which may be very different from each other.', start_char_idx=4794, end_char_idx=10330, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=None),\n",

The overall advantage of this approach compared to the alternatives is its more principled nature, and the capacity to inherently address issues of statistical significance. Most methods in the literature are based on the stochastic block model as well as variants including mixed membership,\\ndegree-correction, and hierarchical structures.Model selection can be performed using principled approaches such as minimum description length (or equivalently, Bayesian model selection) and likelihood-ratio test. Currently many algorithms exist to perform efficient inference of stochastic block models, including belief propagation\\nand agglomerative Monte Carlo.In contrast to approaches that attempt to cluster a network given an objective function, this class of methods is based on generative models, which not only serve as a description of the large-scale structure of the network, but also can be used to generalize the data and predict the occurrence of missing or spurious links in the network.\\n\\n\\n=== Clique-based methods ===\\nCliques are subgraphs in which every node is connected to every other node in the clique.  As nodes can not be more tightly connected than this, it is not surprising that there are many approaches to community detection in networks based on the detection of cliques in a graph and the analysis of how these overlap.  Note that as a node can be a member of more than one clique, a node can be a member of more than one community in these methods giving an \"overlapping community structure\".\\nOne approach is to find the \"maximal cliques\". That is to find the cliques which are not the subgraph of any other clique.  The classic algorithm to find these is the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm. The overlap of these can be used to define communities in several ways.  The simplest is to consider only  maximal cliques bigger than a minimum size (number of nodes).  The union of these cliques then defines a subgraph whose components (disconnected parts) then define communities. Such approaches are often implemented in social network analysis software such as UCInet.\\nThe alternative approach is to use cliques of fixed size \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  . The overlap of these can be used to define a type of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -regular hypergraph or a structure which is a generalisation of the line graph (the case when \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n        =\\n        2\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k=2}\\n  ) known as a \"Clique graph\".  The clique graphs have vertices which represent the cliques in the original graph while the edges of the clique graph record the overlap of the clique in the original graph.  Applying any of the previous community detection methods (which assign each node to a community) to the clique graph then assigns each clique to a community.  This can then be used to determine community membership of nodes in the cliques.  Again as a node may be in several cliques, it can be a member of several communities.\\nFor instance the  clique percolation method defines communities as percolation clusters of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -cliques.

Then, various clustering methods can be employed to detect community structures. For Euclidean spaces, methods like embedding-based Silhouette community detection can be utilized. For Hypergeometric latent spaces, critical gap method or modified density-based, hierarchical, or partitioning-based clustering methods can be utilized.\\n\\n\\n== Testing methods of finding communities algorithms ==\\nThe evaluation of algorithms, to detect which are better at detecting community structure, is still an open question. It must be based on analyses of networks of known structure. A typical example is the \"four groups\" test, in which a network is divided into four equally-sized groups (usually of 32 nodes each) and the probabilities of connection within and between groups varied to create more or less challenging structures for the detection algorithm. Such benchmark graphs are a special case of the planted l-partition model\\nof Condon and Karp, or more generally of \"stochastic block models\", a general class of random network models containing community structure. Other more flexible benchmarks have been proposed that allow for varying group sizes and nontrivial degree distributions, such as LFR benchmark\\nwhich is an extension of the four groups benchmark that includes heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size, making it a more severe test of community detection methods.Commonly used computer-generated benchmarks start with a network of well-defined communities. Then, this structure is degraded by rewiring or removing links and it gets harder and harder for the algorithms to detect the original partition. At the end, the network reaches a point where it is essentially random. This kind of benchmark may be called \"open\". The performance on these benchmarks is evaluated by measures such as normalized mutual information or variation of information.

In a sense, the communities themselves still exist, since the presence and absence of edges is still correlated with the community memberships of their endpoints; but it becomes information-theoretically impossible to label the nodes better than chance, or even distinguish the graph from one generated by a null model such as the Erdos–Renyi model without community structure. This transition is independent of the type of algorithm being used to detect communities, implying that there exists a fundamental limit on our ability to detect communities in networks, even with optimal Bayesian inference (i.e., regardless of our computational resources).Consider a stochastic block model with total \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        n\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle n}\\n   nodes, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        q\\n        =\\n        2\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle q=2}\\n   groups of equal size, and let \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          p\\n          \\n            in\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle p_{\\\\text{in}}}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          p\\n          \\n            out\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle p_{\\\\text{out}}}\\n   be the connection probabilities inside and between the groups respectively.

       "'Response 1: The Louvain Method for Community Detection | The Louvain method is a greedy optimization method developed by Blondel et al. from the University of Louvain for extracting non-overlapping communities from large networks. The method aims to optimize modularity, a measure of the relative density of edges within communities compared to edges between communities. By iteratively optimizing modularity locally on all nodes and grouping small communities into one node, the Louvain method produces the best possible grouping of nodes in a network. The method has a time complexity of O(n*log(n)), where n is the number of nodes in the network.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 2: Algorithm for Optimizing Modularity in Networks | This text explains the algorithm for optimizing modularity in networks. Modularity is a measure of the density of links within communities compared to links between communities. The algorithm uses the Louvain Method, which has two phases. In the first phase, each node is assigned to its own community. In the second phase, the change in modularity is calculated for moving a node from its own community to the community of each of its neighbors. This process is repeated iteratively to maximize modularity efficiently.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 3: Modularity Optimization Algorithm for Community Detection | The text describes a modularity optimization algorithm for community detection in a network. The algorithm assigns each node to its own community and then calculates the change in modularity for moving the node into the community of each of its neighbors. The algorithm uses equations to calculate the modularity change and places the node into the community that results in the greatest increase in modularity. This process is repeated for all nodes until no further increase in modularity is possible. The algorithm aims to find the local maximum of modularity, indicating the optimal community structure in the network.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 4: Louvain Method for Community Detection in Large Networks | The Louvain method is an algorithm used for community detection in large networks. It involves two phases: in the first phase, nodes are iteratively moved to communities that result in the greatest increase in modularity. In the second phase, the nodes are grouped into communities and a new network is created. The Louvain method has been used in various applications, such as partitioning online social networks and identifying dynamic communities in mobile phone networks. However, it has limitations, such as producing only non-overlapping communities and sometimes creating poorly connected communities. Nonetheless, it has been shown to outperform other modularity optimization methods in terms of both speed and resulting modularity value.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 5: The Importance of Modularity in Network Analysis | Modularity is a measure of the structure of networks that determines the strength of division into modules or communities. It is commonly used in optimization methods for detecting community structure in networks. However, modularity maximization is not statistically consistent and cannot be used to find statistically significant community structures in real-world networks. Additionally, modularity suffers from a resolution limit and is unable to detect small communities. Despite these limitations, modularity is still an important measure in network analysis as it helps reveal unexpected structural features and understand the dynamics of various networks.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 6: Modularity in Graph Theory | Modularity is a measure of the concentration of edges within groups compared to a random distribution of links between all nodes. It is calculated by subtracting the expected fraction of edges within groups from the actual fraction. The value of modularity for unweighted and undirected graphs ranges from -1/2 to 1, with positive values indicating a higher number of edges within groups than expected by chance. Different methods can be used to calculate modularity, with the most common version preserving the degree of each vertex. The expected number of edges is computed using a configuration model, which randomizes the network while maintaining the node degree distribution.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 7: Expected Number of Edges Between Nodes | This text discusses the calculation of the expected number of edges between two nodes in a randomly rewired network. It explains the use of indicator variables to determine if a stub of one node connects to a stub of the other node. The indicator variables are set to 1 if a connection is made and 0 if not. The text provides a mathematical approach to calculating the expected number of full edges between the nodes.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 8: Approximations for Expected Number of Edges in Random Networks | This text discusses the approximations made for the expected number of edges between two nodes in random networks with a large number of edges. It explains that when the number of edges is large, the subtraction of 1 in the denominator is dropped, and the approximate expression k_v * k_w / 2m is used instead.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 9: Modularity and Community Detection in Networks | This text explains the concept of modularity in network analysis and its application in community detection. It discusses the approximation of the expected number of edges between nodes in a large random network and how it can be used to calculate the probability of an edge existing between two nodes. The text also mentions the equation for modularity and its use in partitioning a network into communities. It concludes with an example of multiple community detection and an alternative formulation of modularity.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 10: Matrix Formulation of Modularity for Community Detection | This text explains the matrix formulation of modularity, which is a measure used in community detection algorithms. The modularity matrix is defined using the adjacency matrix of a network and represents the optimal community partitions. The formula for modularity involves the sum of elements in the modularity matrix and the transpose of the matrix. The modularity of an undivided network is always zero.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 11: Limitations of Modularity Maximization for Community Detection | Modularity maximization, a method commonly used for community detection in networks, has several limitations. Firstly, it is prone to overfitting and often finds high-scoring communities in its own null model, which are not statistically significant. Secondly, it suffers from a resolution limit, where it fails to detect small communities in large networks. This is because the null model assumes that each node can be connected to any other node, which is unrealistic for large networks. To address these limitations, multiresolution methods have been proposed, but they also have limitations when communities are highly heterogeneous in size.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 12: Multiresolution Methods for Community Detection in Networks | This text discusses two main approaches for solving the resolution limit in community detection within the modularity context. One approach involves adding a resistance parameter to each node, either increasing or decreasing their aversion to form communities. The other approach involves adding a parameter that controls the relative importance between internal links of the communities and the null model. These multiresolution methods allow for the recovery of the entire mesoscale of a network, from a macro-scale where all nodes belong to the same community, to a micro-scale where each node forms its own community. However, these methods have limitations when communities vary greatly in size. The text also mentions several software tools available for computing clusterings with good modularity.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 13: The Importance of Community Structure in Networks | Community structure refers to the occurrence of groups of nodes in a network that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. This structure is common in various types of networks, including social networks, biological networks, and information networks. Identifying community structure is important for understanding network function and topology, as communities often correspond to functional units of the system. Additionally, communities can affect processes such as rumor spreading and epidemic spreading on a network. Various algorithms have been developed to find communities within networks, despite the computational challenges posed by the unknown number and unequal size/density of communities.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 14: Algorithms for Finding Communities in Networks | This text discusses various algorithms for finding communities within networks. The minimum-cut method divides the network into parts by minimizing the number of edges between groups. Hierarchical clustering groups similar nodes into communities based on a similarity measure. The Girvan-Newman algorithm identifies edges between communities and removes them. Modularity maximization searches for divisions of the network with high modularity, with the Louvain method being a popular approach. The RenEEL scheme is currently the best modularity maximizing algorithm. However, modularity optimization has limitations in detecting small clusters and has a degeneracy of partitions with high modularity.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 15: Methods for Community Detection in Networks | This text discusses two approaches for community detection in networks: statistical inference and clique-based methods. Statistical inference involves fitting a generative model to the network data, allowing for the identification of community structures and addressing issues of statistical significance. Clique-based methods, on the other hand, focus on detecting cliques in the graph and analyzing their overlap to define communities. These methods can be implemented using algorithms such as the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm or by creating clique graphs. Both approaches offer different ways to identify communities in networks and can be used to predict missing or spurious links.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 16: Testing Methods for Community Detection Algorithms | This text discusses the evaluation of algorithms for detecting community structures in networks. It highlights the importance of analyzing networks of known structure to determine the effectiveness of different algorithms. The \"four groups\" test is commonly used, where a network is divided into four equally-sized groups and the probabilities of connection within and between groups are varied. Other benchmarks, such as the LFR benchmark, allow for varying group sizes and nontrivial degree distributions. These benchmarks help assess the performance of algorithms by comparing the obtained solution with the original community structure using measures like normalized mutual information or variation of information.\\n---------------------\\nResponse 17: Detectability of Communities in Networks | This text discusses the concept of detectability in community detection problems in networks. It explains that there is a phase transition in detectability, where communities become undetectable as the density of connections within and between communities becomes more equal or smaller. While the communities still exist, it becomes impossible to label nodes or distinguish the graph from a null model without community structure. This transition is independent of the algorithm used for community detection, suggesting a fundamental limit on our ability to detect communities in networks. The text also mentions the conditions under which communities become undetectable in a stochastic block model.'"

Modularity is a scale value between −0.5 (non-modular clustering) and 1 (fully modular clustering) that measures the relative density of edges inside communities with respect to edges outside communities. Optimizing this value theoretically results in the best possible grouping of the nodes of a given network. But because going through all possible iterations of the nodes into groups is impractical, heuristic algorithms are used.\\nIn the Louvain Method of community detection, first small communities are found by optimizing modularity locally on all nodes, then each small community is grouped into one node and the first step is repeated. The method is similar to the earlier method by Clauset, Newman and Moore that connects communities whose amalgamation produces the largest increase in modularity.\\n\\n\\n== Algorithm ==\\nThe value to be optimized is modularity, defined as a value in the range \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        [\\n        −\\n        1\\n        \\n          /\\n        \\n        2\\n        ,\\n        1\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle [-1/2,1]}\\n   that measures the density of links inside communities compared to links between communities. For a weighted graph, modularity is defined as:\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Q\\n        =\\n        \\n          \\n            1\\n            \\n              2\\n              m\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          ∑\\n          \\n            i\\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            [\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            i\\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n        −\\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                k\\n                \\n                  i\\n                \\n              \\n              \\n                k\\n                \\n                  j\\n                \\n              \\n            \\n            \\n              2\\n              m\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            ]\\n          \\n        \\n        δ\\n        (\\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n        ,\\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n        )\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle Q={\\\\frac {1}{2m}}\\\\sum \\\\limits _{ij}{\\\\bigg [}A_{ij}-{\\\\frac {k_{i}k_{j}}{2m}}{\\\\bigg ]}\\\\delta (c_{i},c_{j}),}\\n  \\nwhere\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            i\\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{ij}}\\n   represents the edge weight between nodes \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        i\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle i}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        j\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle j}\\n  ;\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{i}}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{j}}\\n   are the sum of the weights of the edges attached to nodes \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        i\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle i}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        j\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle j}\\n  , respectively;\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        m\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle m}\\n   is the sum of all of the edge weights in the graph;\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            i\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle c_{i}}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          c\\n          \\n            j\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle c_{j}}\\n   are the communities of the nodes;

If no increase is possible, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        i\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle i}\\n   remains in its original community. This process is applied repeatedly and sequentially to all nodes until no modularity increase can occur. Once this local maximum of modularity is hit, the first phase has ended.\\nIn the second phase of the algorithm, it groups all of the nodes in the same community and builds a new network where nodes are the communities from the previous phase. Any links between nodes of the same community are now represented by self-loops on the new community node and links from multiple nodes in the same community to a node in a different community are represented by weighted edges between communities. Once the new network is created, the second phase has ended and the first phase can be re-applied to the new network.\\n\\n\\n== Previous uses ==\\nTwitter social Network (2.4 Million nodes, 38 million links) by Josep Pujol, Vijay Erramilli, and Pablo Rodriguez: The authors explore the problem of partitioning Online Social Networks onto different machines.\\nMobile phone Network (4 Million nodes, 100 Million links) by Derek Greene, Donal Doyle, and Padraig Cunningham: Community-tracking strategies for identifying dynamic communities of different dynamic social networks.\\nDetecting species in network-based dynamical model.\\n\\n\\n== Disadvantages ==\\nIt is important to emphasize that Louvain produces only non-overlapping communities, which means that each node can belong to at most one community. This is highly unrealistic in many real-world applications. For example, in social networks, most people belong to multiple communities: their family, their friends, their co-workers, old school buddies, etc. In biological networks, most genes or proteins belong to more than one pathway or complex. Furthermore, Louvain has been shown to sometimes produce arbitrarily badly connected communities, and has been effectively superseded (at least in the non-overlapping case) by the Leiden algorithm.\\n\\n\\n== Comparison to other methods of non-overlapping community detection ==\\nWhen comparing modularity optimization methods, the two measures of importance are the speed and the resulting modularity value. A higher speed is better as it shows a method is more efficient than others and a higher modularity value is desirable as it points to having better-defined communities.\\nThe compared methods are, the algorithm of Clauset, Newman, and Moore, Pons and Latapy, and Wakita and Tsurumi.\\n-/- in the table refers to a method that took over 24hrs to run. This table (from) shows that the Louvain method outperforms many similar modularity optimization methods in both the modularity and the time categories.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nModularity (networks)\\nCommunity structure\\nNetwork science\\nK-means clustering\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\"The Louvain method for community detection in large networks\" Vincent Blondel http://perso.uclouvain.be/vincent.blondel/research/louvain.html', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules. Modularity is often used in optimization methods for detecting community structure in networks.  Biological networks, including animal brains, exhibit a high degree of modularity. However, modularity maximization is not statistically consistent, and finds communities in its own null model, i.e. fully random graphs, and therefore it cannot be used to find statistically significant community structures in empirical networks. Furthermore, it has been shown that modularity suffers a resolution limit and, therefore, it is unable to detect small communities.\\n\\n\\n== Motivation ==\\nMany scientifically important problems can be represented and empirically studied using networks. For example, biological and social patterns, the World Wide Web, metabolic networks, food webs, neural networks and pathological networks are real world problems that can be mathematically represented and topologically studied to reveal some unexpected structural features. Most of these networks possess a certain community structure that has substantial importance in building an understanding regarding the dynamics of the network. For instance, a closely connected social community will imply a faster rate of transmission of information or rumor among them than a loosely connected community. Thus, if a network is represented by a number of individual nodes connected by links which signify a certain degree of interaction between the nodes, communities are defined as groups of densely interconnected nodes that are only sparsely connected with the rest of the network. Hence, it may be imperative to identify the communities in networks since the communities may have quite different properties such as node degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness, centrality, etc., from that of the average network. Modularity is one such measure, which when maximized, leads to the appearance of communities in a given network.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nModularity is the fraction of the edges that fall within the given groups minus the expected fraction if edges were distributed at random. The value of the modularity for unweighted and undirected graphs lies in the range \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        [\\n        −\\n        1\\n        \\n          /\\n        \\n        2\\n        ,\\n        1\\n        ]\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle [-1/2,1]}\\n  .  It is positive if the number of edges within groups exceeds the number expected on the basis of chance. For a given division of the network's vertices into some modules, modularity reflects the concentration of edges within modules compared with random distribution of links between all nodes regardless of modules.\\nThere are different methods for calculating modularity. In the most common version of the concept, the randomization of the edges is done so as to preserve the degree of each vertex. Consider a graph with \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        n\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle n}\\n   nodes and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        m\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle m}\\n   links (edges) such that the graph can be partitioned into two communities using a membership variable \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        s\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle s}\\n  . If a node \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   belongs to community 1, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          s\\n          \\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle s_{v}=1}\\n  , or if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   belongs to community 2, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          s\\n          \\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        −\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle s_{v}=-1}\\n  . Let the adjacency matrix for the network be represented by \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        A\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A}\\n  , where \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            v\\n            w\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{vw}=0}\\n   means there's no edge (no interaction) between nodes \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        w\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle w}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            v\\n            w\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{vw}=1}\\n   means there is an edge between the two. Also for simplicity we consider an undirected network. Thus \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            v\\n            w\\n          \\n        \\n        =\\n        \\n          A\\n          \\n            w\\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A_{vw}=A_{wv}}\\n  . (It is important to note that multiple edges may exist between two nodes, but here we assess the simplest case).\\nModularity \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        Q\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle Q}\\n   is then defined as the fraction of edges that fall within group 1 or 2, minus the expected number of edges within groups 1 and 2 for a random graph with the same node degree distribution as the given network.\\nThe expected number of edges shall be computed using the concept of a configuration model. The configuration model is a randomized realization of a particular network. Given a network with \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        n\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle n}\\n   nodes, where each node \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   has a node degree \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{v}}\\n  , the configuration model cuts each edge into two halves,  and then each half edge, called a stub, is rewired randomly with any other stub in the network, even allowing self-loops (which occur when a stub is rewired to another stub from the same node) and multiple-edges between the same two nodes. Thus, even though the node degree distribution of the graph remains intact, the configuration model results in a completely random network.\\n\\n\\n== Expected Number of Edges Between Nodes ==\\nNow consider two nodes \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        w\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle w}\\n  , with node degrees \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            v\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{v}}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          k\\n          \\n            w\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k_{w}}\\n   respectively, from a randomly rewired network as described above.

annealing, to maximize the modularity.  The general form of the modularity for arbitrary numbers of communities is equivalent to a Potts spin glass and similar algorithms can be developed for this case also.\\n\\n\\n== Overfitting ==\\nAlthough the method of modularity maximization is motivated by computing a deviation from a null model, this deviation is not computed in a statistically consistent manner. Because of this, the method notoriously finds high-scoring communities in its own null model\\n\\n(the configuration model), which by definition cannot be statistically significant. Because of this, the method cannot be used to reliably obtain statistically significant community structure in empirical networks.\\n\\n\\n== Resolution limit ==\\nModularity compares the number of edges inside a cluster with the expected number of edges that\\none would find in the cluster if the network were a random network with the same number of nodes and where\\neach node keeps its degree, but edges are otherwise randomly attached. This random null model implicitly assumes that each node can get attached to any other node of the network. This assumption is however unreasonable if the network is very large, as the horizon of a node includes a small part of the network, ignoring most of it.\\nMoreover, this implies that the expected number of edges between two groups of nodes decreases if the size of the network increases. So, if a network is large enough, the expected number of edges between two groups of nodes in modularity's null model may be smaller than one. If this happens, a single edge between the two clusters would be interpreted by modularity as a sign of a strong correlation between the two clusters, and optimizing modularity would lead to the merging of the two clusters, independently of the clusters' features. So, even weakly interconnected complete graphs, which have the highest possible density of internal edges, and represent the best identifiable communities, would be merged by modularity optimization if the network were sufficiently large.\\nFor this reason, optimizing modularity in large networks would fail to resolve small communities, even when they are well defined. This bias\\nis inevitable for methods like modularity optimization, which rely on a global null model.\\n\\n\\n== Multiresolution methods ==\\nThere are two main approaches which try to solve the resolution limit within the modularity context: the addition of a resistance r to every node, in the form of a self-loop, which increases (r>0) or decreases (r<0) the aversion of nodes to form communities; or the addition of a parameter γ>0 in front of the null-case term in the definition of modularity, which controls the relative importance between internal links of the communities and the null model. Optimizing modularity for values of these parameters in their respective appropriate ranges, it is possible to recover the whole mesoscale of the network, from the macroscale in which all nodes belong to the same community, to the microscale in which every node forms its own community, hence the name multiresolution methods. However, it has been shown that these methods have limitations when communities are very heterogeneous in size.\\n\\n\\n== Software Tools ==\\nThere are a couple of software tools available that are able to compute clusterings in graphs with good modularity.\\nOriginal implementation of the multi-level Louvain method.The Leiden algorithm which additionally avoids unconnected communities.The Vienna Graph Clustering (VieClus) algorithm, a parallel memetic algorithm.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nComplex network\\nCommunity structure\\nNull model\\nPercolation theory\\n\\n\\n== References ==\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In the particular case of non-overlapping community finding, this implies that the network divides naturally into groups of nodes with dense connections internally and sparser connections between groups.  But overlapping communities are also allowed. The more general definition is based on the principle that pairs of nodes are more likely to be connected if they are both members of the same community(ies), and less likely to be connected if they do not share communities. A related but different problem is community search, where the goal is to find a community that a certain vertex belongs to.\\n\\n\\n== Properties ==\\nIn the study of networks, such as computer and information networks, social networks and biological networks, a number of different characteristics have been found to occur commonly, including the small-world property, heavy-tailed degree distributions, and clustering, among others. Another common characteristic is community structure.\\nIn the context of networks, community structure refers to the occurrence of groups of nodes in a network that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network, as shown in the example image to the right.  This inhomogeneity of connections suggests that the network has certain natural divisions within it.\\nCommunities are often defined in terms of the partition of the set of vertices, that is each node is put into one and only one community, just as in the figure. This is a useful simplification and most community detection methods find this type of community structure. However, in some cases a better representation could be one where vertices are in more than one community.  This might happen in a social network where each vertex represents a person, and the communities represent the different groups of friends: one community for family, another community for co-workers, one for friends in the same sports club, and so on. The use of cliques for community detection discussed below is just one example of how such overlapping community structure can be found.\\nSome networks may not have any meaningful community structure.  Many basic network models, for example, such as the random graph and the Barabási–Albert model, do not display community structure.\\n\\n\\n== Importance ==\\nCommunity structures are quite common in real networks. Social networks include community groups (the origin of the term, in fact) based on common location, interests, occupation, etc.Finding an underlying community structure in a network, if it exists, is important for a number of reasons. Communities allow us to create a large scale map of a network since individual communities act like meta-nodes in the network which makes its study easier.Individual communities also shed light on the function of the system represented by the network since communities often correspond to functional units of the system. In metabolic networks, such functional groups correspond to cycles or pathways whereas in the protein interaction network, communities correspond to proteins with similar functionality inside a biological cell. Similarly, citation networks form communities by research topic. Being able to identify these sub-structures within a network can provide insight into how network function and topology affect each other. Such insight can be useful in improving some algorithms on graphs such as spectral clustering.Importantly, communities often have very different properties than the average properties of the networks. Thus, only concentrating on the average properties usually misses many important and interesting features inside the networks. For example, in a given social network, both gregarious and reticent groups might exists simultaneously.Existence of communities also generally affects various processes like rumour spreading or epidemic spreading happening on a network. Hence to properly understand such processes, it is important to detect communities and also to study how they affect the spreading processes in various settings.\\nFinally, an important application that community detection has found in network science is the prediction of missing links and the identification of false links in the network. During the measurement process, some links may not get observed for a number of reasons. Similarly, some links could falsely enter into the data because of the errors in the measurement. Both these cases are well handled by community detection algorithm since it allows one to assign the probability of existence of an edge between a given pair of nodes.\\n\\n\\n== Algorithms for finding communities ==\\nFinding communities within an arbitrary network can be a computationally difficult task.  The number of communities, if any, within the network is typically unknown and the communities are often of unequal size and/or density.  Despite these difficulties, however, several methods for community finding have been developed and employed with varying levels of success.\\n\\n\\n=== Minimum-cut method ===\\nOne of the oldest algorithms for dividing networks into parts is the minimum cut method (and variants such as ratio cut and normalized cut).  This method sees use, for example, in load balancing for parallel computing in order to minimize communication between processor nodes.\\nIn the minimum-cut method, the network is divided into a predetermined number of parts, usually of approximately the same size, chosen such that the number of edges between groups is minimized.  The method works well in many of the applications for which it was originally intended but is less than ideal for finding community structure in general networks since it will find communities regardless of whether they are implicit in the structure, and it will find only a fixed number of them.\\n\\n\\n=== Hierarchical clustering ===\\nAnother method for finding community structures in networks is hierarchical clustering.  In this method one defines a similarity measure quantifying some (usually topological) type of similarity between node pairs.  Commonly used measures include the cosine similarity, the Jaccard index, and the Hamming distance between rows of the adjacency matrix.  Then one groups similar nodes into communities according to this measure.  There are several common schemes for performing the grouping, the two simplest being single-linkage clustering, in which two groups are considered separate communities if and only if all pairs of nodes in different groups have similarity lower than a given threshold, and complete linkage clustering, in which all nodes within every group have similarity greater than a threshold. An important step is how to determine the threshold to stop the agglomerative clustering, indicating a near-to-optimal community structure. A common strategy consist to build one or several metrics monitoring global properties of the network, which peak at given step of the clustering. An interesting approach in this direction is the use of various similarity or dissimilarity measures, combined through convex sums,. Another approximation is the computation of a quantity monitoring the density of edges within clusters with respect to the density between clusters, such as the partition density, which has been proposed when the similarity metric is defined between edges (which permits the definition of overlapping communities), and extended when the similarity is defined between nodes, which allows to consider alternative definitions of communities such as guilds (i.e. groups of nodes sharing a similar number of links with respect to the same neighbours but not necessarily connected themselves). These methods can be extended to consider multidimensional networks, for instance when we are dealing with networks having nodes with different types of links.\\n\\n\\n=== Girvan–Newman algorithm ===\\nAnother commonly used algorithm for finding communities is the Girvan–Newman algorithm.  This algorithm identifies edges in a network that lie between communities and then removes them, leaving behind just the communities themselves.  The identification is performed by employing the graph-theoretic measure betweenness centrality, which assigns a number to each edge which is large if the edge lies \"between\" many pairs of nodes.\\nThe Girvan–Newman algorithm returns results of reasonable quality and is popular because it has been implemented in a number of standard software packages.  But it also runs slowly, taking time O(m2n) on a network of n vertices and m edges, making it impractical for networks of more than a few thousand nodes.\\n\\n\\n=== Modularity maximization ===\\nIn spite of its known drawbacks, one of the most widely used methods for community detection is modularity maximization.  Modularity is a benefit function that measures the quality of a particular division of a network into communities.  The modularity maximization method detects communities by searching over possible divisions of a network for one or more that have particularly high modularity.  Since exhaustive search over all possible divisions is usually intractable, practical algorithms are based on approximate optimization methods such as greedy algorithms, simulated annealing, or spectral optimization, with different approaches offering different balances between speed and accuracy.\\nA popular modularity maximization approach is the Louvain method, which iteratively optimizes local communities until global modularity can no longer be improved given perturbations to the current community state.\\nAn algorithm that utilizes the RenEEL scheme, which is an example of the Extremal Ensemble Learning (EEL) paradigm, is currently the best modularity maximizing algorithm.The usefulness of modularity optimization is questionable, as it has been shown that modularity optimization often fails to detect clusters smaller than some scale, depending on the size of the network (resolution limit); on the other hand the landscape of modularity values is characterized by a huge degeneracy of partitions with high modularity, close to the absolute maximum, which may be very different from each other.\\n\\n\\n=== Statistical inference ===\\nMethods based on statistical inference attempt to fit a generative model to the network data, which encodes the community structure. The overall advantage of this approach compared to the alternatives is its more principled nature, and the capacity to inherently address issues of statistical significance. Most methods in the literature are based on the stochastic block model as well as variants including mixed membership,\\ndegree-correction, and hierarchical structures.Model selection can be performed using principled approaches such as minimum description length (or equivalently, Bayesian model selection) and likelihood-ratio test. Currently many algorithms exist to perform efficient inference of stochastic block models, including belief propagation\\nand agglomerative Monte Carlo.In contrast to approaches that attempt to cluster a network given an objective function, this class of methods is based on generative models, which not only serve as a description of the large-scale structure of the network, but also can be used to generalize the data and predict the occurrence of missing or spurious links in the network.\\n\\n\\n=== Clique-based methods ===\\nCliques are subgraphs in which every node is connected to every other node in the clique.  As nodes can not be more tightly connected than this, it is not surprising that there are many approaches to community detection in networks based on the detection of cliques in a graph and the analysis of how these overlap.  Note that as a node can be a member of more than one clique, a node can be a member of more than one community in these methods giving an \"overlapping community structure\".\\nOne approach is to find the \"maximal cliques\". That is to find the cliques which are not the subgraph of any other clique.  The classic algorithm to find these is the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm. The overlap of these can be used to define communities in several ways.  The simplest is to consider only  maximal cliques bigger than a minimum size (number of nodes).  The union of these cliques then defines a subgraph whose components (disconnected parts) then define communities. Such approaches are often implemented in social network analysis software such as UCInet.\\nThe alternative approach is to use cliques of fixed size \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  . The overlap of these can be used to define a type of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -regular hypergraph or a structure which is a generalisation of the line graph (the case when \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n        =\\n        2\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k=2}\\n  ) known as a \"Clique graph\".  The clique graphs have vertices which represent the cliques in the original graph while the edges of the clique graph record the overlap of the clique in the original graph.  Applying any of the previous community detection methods (which assign each node to a community) to the clique graph then assigns each clique to a community.  This can then be used to determine community membership of nodes in the cliques.  Again as a node may be in several cliques, it can be a member of several communities.\\nFor instance the  clique percolation method defines communities as percolation clusters of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -cliques. To do this it\\nfinds all \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -cliques in a network, that is all the complete sub-graphs of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -nodes.\\nIt then defines two \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -cliques to be adjacent if they share \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n        −\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k-1}\\n   nodes, that is this is used to define edges in a clique graph. A community is then defined to be the maximal union of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -cliques in which we can reach any \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -clique from any other \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -clique through series of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -clique adjacencies. That is communities are just the connected components in the clique graph. Since a node can belong to several different \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  -clique percolation clusters at the same time, the communities can overlap with each other.\\n\\n\\n=== Community detection in latent feature spaces ===\\nA network can be represented or projected onto a latent space via representation learning methods to efficiently represent a system. Then, various clustering methods can be employed to detect community structures. For Euclidean spaces, methods like embedding-based Silhouette community detection can be utilized. For Hypergeometric latent spaces, critical gap method or modified density-based, hierarchical, or partitioning-based clustering methods can be utilized.\\n\\n\\n== Testing methods of finding communities algorithms ==\\nThe evaluation of algorithms, to detect which are better at detecting community structure, is still an open question. It must be based on analyses of networks of known structure. A typical example is the \"four groups\" test, in which a network is divided into four equally-sized groups (usually of 32 nodes each) and the probabilities of connection within and between groups varied to create more or less challenging structures for the detection algorithm. Such benchmark graphs are a special case of the planted l-partition model\\nof Condon and Karp, or more generally of \"stochastic block models\", a general class of random network models containing community structure. Other more flexible benchmarks have been proposed that allow for varying group sizes and nontrivial degree distributions, such as LFR benchmark\\nwhich is an extension of the four groups benchmark that includes heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size, making it a more severe test of community detection methods.Commonly used computer-generated benchmarks start with a network of well-defined communities. Then, this structure is degraded by rewiring or removing links and it gets harder and harder for the algorithms to detect the original partition. At the end, the network reaches a point where it is essentially random. This kind of benchmark may be called \"open\". The performance on these benchmarks is evaluated by measures such as normalized mutual information or variation of information. They compare the solution obtained by an algorithm  with the original community structure, evaluating the similarity of both partitions.\\n\\n\\n== Detectability ==\\nDuring recent years, a rather surprising result has been obtained by various groups which shows that a phase transition exists in the community detection problem, showing that as the density of connections inside communities and between communities become more and more equal or both become smaller (equivalently, as the community structure becomes too weak or the network becomes too sparse), suddenly the communities become undetectable. In a sense, the communities themselves still exist, since the presence and absence of edges is still correlated with the community memberships of their endpoints; but it becomes information-theoretically impossible to label the nodes better than chance, or even distinguish the graph from one generated by a null model such as the Erdos–Renyi model without community structure. This transition is independent of the type of algorithm being used to detect communities, implying that there exists a fundamental limit on our ability to detect communities in networks, even with optimal Bayesian inference (i.e., regardless of our computational resources).Consider a stochastic block model with total \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        n\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle n}\\n   nodes, \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        q\\n        =\\n        2\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle q=2}\\n   groups of equal size, and let \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          p\\n          \\n            in\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle p_{\\\\text{in}}}\\n   and \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          p\\n          \\n            out\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle p_{\\\\text{out}}}\\n   be the connection probabilities inside and between the groups respectively.
