      "Summary::\n",
      "Bacteriophages are employed as cost-effective and efficient antibacterial agents to counter the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other host bacteria in phage therapy. The increasing incidence of skin wounds is a significant concern in clinical practice, especially considering the limitations of antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, the lack of an effective delivery system that preserves the stability of bacteriophages hampers their clinical implementation. In recent years, there has been a growing amount of research on bacteriophage applications in veterinary and biomedical sciences. In our study, lytic coliphage vB_Eco2571-YU1 was isolated against pathogenic Escherichia coli host bacteria, and hydrogel wound dressing materials were fabricated with marine polysaccharide carrageenan (carr-vB_Eco2571-YU1) for their antibacterial activity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) morphology identified it as a Myoviridae coliphage with an icosahedral head length and width of approximately 60 and 56.8 nm, respectively, and a tail length of 119.7 nm. The one-step growth curve of coliphage revealed a latent period of 10 min, a rise period of 15 min, and a burst size of 120 virions per cell. The bacteriolytic activity of unimmobilized coliphages was observed within 2 h; however, strain-specific phage resistance was acquired after 9 h. In contrast, carr-vB_Eco2571-YU1 showed a sharp decline in the growth of bacteria in the log phase after 2 h and did not allow for the acquisition of phage resistance by the E. coli strain. The stability of coliphage under different pH, temperature, osmolarity, detergents, and organic solvents was evaluated. We also studied the long-term storage of carr-vB_Eco2571-YU1 hydrogels\u001b[0mINFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\"\n",

      "IMPORTANCE\n",
      "Therapeutic bacteriophages (phages) are being considered as alternatives in the fight against Clostridioides difficile infections. To be efficient, phages should have a wide host range, buthe lack of knowledge about the cell receptor used by C. difficile phages hampers the rational design of phage cocktails. Recent reports suggested that the C. difficile surface layer protein A (SlpA) is an important phage receptor, but available data are still limited. Here, using the epidemic R20291 strain and its FM2.5 mutant derivative lacking a functional S-layer, we show that the absence of SlpA renders cells completely resistant to infection by ϕCD38-2, ϕCD111, and ϕCD146, which normally infect the parental strain. Complementation with 12 different S-layer cassette types (SLCTs) expressed from a plasmid revealed that SLCT-6 also allowed infection by ϕCD111 and SLCT-11 enabled infection by ϕCD38-2 and ϕCD146. Of note, the expression of SLCT-1, -6, -8, -9, -10, or -12 conferred susceptibility to infection by 5 myophages that normally do not infect the R20291 strain. Also, deletion of the D2 domain within the low-molecular-weight fragment of SlpA was found to abolish infection by ϕCD38-2 and ϕCD146 but not ϕCD111. Altogether, our data suggest that many phages use SlpA as their receptor and, most importantly, that both siphophages and myophages target SlpA despite major differences in their tail structures. Our study therefore represents an important step in understanding the interactions between C. difficile and its phages.  Phage therapy represents an interesting alternative to treat Clostridioides difficile infections because, contrary to antibiotics, most phages are highly species specific, thereby sparing the beneficial gut microbes that protect from infection. However, currently available phages against C. difficile \u001b[0mINFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\"\n",

      "() is a swine pathogen that can cause sepsis, meningitis, endocarditis, and other infectious diseases; it is also a zoonotic pathogen that has caused a global surge in fatal human infections. The widespread prevalence of multidrug-resistant  strains and the decline in novel antibiotic candidates have necessitated the development of alternative antimicrobial agents. In this study, AVPL, the  () phage lysin, was found to exhibit efficient bactericidal activity and broad lytic activity against multiple serotypes of . A final concentration of 300 μg/mL AVPL reduced  counts by 4-4.5 log10 within 1 h in vitro. Importantly, AVPL effectively inhibited 48 h  biofilm formation and disrupted preformed biofilms. In a mouse model, 300 μg/mouse AVPL protected 100% of mice from infection following the administration of lethal doses of multidrug-resistant  type 2 (SS2) strain SC19, reduced the bacterial load in different organs, and effectively alleviated inflammation and histopathological damage in infected mice. These data suggest that AVPL is a valuable candidate antimicrobial agent for treating  infections.\n",

      "In this study, we aimed to design a novel and effective bacteriophage cocktail that can target both wild-type bacteria and phage-resistant mutants. To achieve this goal, we isolated four phages (U2874, phi_KPN_H2, phi_KPN_S3, and phi_KPN_HS3) that recognized different bacterial surface molecules using phage-resistant bacteria.

      "6. Research support: This section will list the research studies that have been conducted on the bacteriophage and their findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "These sections are important because they provide a comprehensive overview of the bacteriophage, including its effectiveness and potential challenges. They also provide evidence-based information that is supported by scientific research.\n",

S. Boev, A. S. Rakitko, S. R. Usmanov, A. N. Kobzeva, I. V. Popov, V. V. Ilinsky, E. O. Kiktenko, A. K. Fedorov\\nSummary: Recent advances in DNA sequencing open prospects to make whole-genome\\nanalysis rapid and reliable, which is promising for various applications\\nincluding personalized medicine. However, existing techniques for {\\\\it de novo}\\ngenome assembly, which is used for the analysis of genomic rearrangements,\\nchromosome phasing, and reconstructing genomes without a reference, require\\nsolving tasks of high computational complexity. Here we demonstrate a method\\nfor solving genome assembly tasks with the use of quantum and quantum-inspired\\noptimization techniques. Within this method, we present experimental results on\\ngenome assembly using quantum annealers both for simulated data and the $\\\\phi$X\\n174 bacteriophage. Our results pave a way for an increase in the efficiency of\\nsolving bioinformatics problems with the use of quantum computing and, in\\nparticular, quantum annealing. We expect that the new generation of quantum\\nannealing devices would outperform existing techniques for {\\\\it de novo} genome\\nassembly.

      "Final Answer: Bacteriophage Phi X 174 has historically been significant in the field of DNA sequencing and bacteriophage treatments. Its genome is relatively small and has been extensively studied as a model organism, which has contributed to advances in nanopore sequencing technology. This technology can sequence reads of Phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length that can be unambiguously aligned to the Phi X 174 reference genome. This has proven useful for hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism detection [1]. Moreover, in the context of bacteriophage treatments, coinfections modeling that involve Phi X 174 have been analyzed. These studies show how coinfection affects the dose of bacteriophages needed to eliminate bacteria and the velocity of convergence to the bacteria-free equilibrium [2]. Recent advances in DNA sequencing have opened prospects to make whole-genome analysis rapid and reliable, with Phi X 174 being used in experimental genome assembly tasks using quantum and quantum-inspired optimization techniques [3].\n",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study of\\nde novo genome assembly problems both for real and synthetic data on quantum\\nannealing devices and quantum-inspired techniques.\\nThought: The articles found do not provide historical background or details on the discovery of the bacteriophage Phi X 174. They do however provide some information on its use in recent research, including DNA sequencing and bacteriophage treatments. To find more detailed information on the history and significance of this bacteriophage, I may have to use another tool or delegate this task to a co-worker who might have access to different resources. \\nAction: Delegate work to co-worker\\nAction Input: Microbiologist|Research the history and significance of Bacteriophage Phi X 174 in antibiotic-resistant treatments|I was unable to find detailed information on the historical background and discovery of Bacteriophage Phi X 174. I have found some recent articles on its use in DNA sequencing and bacteriophage treatments, but not enough to write a comprehensive introduction. Please use any resources available to you to find more detailed information.\\nObservation: Bacteriophage Phi X 174 has historically been significant in the field of DNA sequencing and bacteriophage treatments. Its genome is relatively small and has been extensively studied as a model organism, which has contributed to advances in nanopore sequencing technology. This technology can sequence reads of Phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length that can be unambiguously aligned to the Phi X 174 reference genome. This has proven useful for hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism detection [1]. Moreover, in the context of bacteriophage treatments, coinfections modeling that involve Phi X 174 have been analyzed. These studies show how coinfection affects the dose of bacteriophages needed to eliminate bacteria and the velocity of convergence to the bacteria-free equilibrium [2]. Recent advances in DNA sequencing have opened prospects to make whole-genome analysis rapid and reliable, with Phi X 174 being used in experimental genome assembly tasks using quantum and quantum-inspired optimization techniques [3].\\n\\nReferences:\\n[1] Laszlo et al., Nanopore Sequencing of the phi X 174 genome, 2014.\\n[2] Bardina and Rovira, Coinfection in a stochastic model for bacteriophage systems, 2017.\\n[3] Boev et al., Genome assembly using quantum and quantum-inspired annealing, 2021.\\nThought: '}], 'model': 'gpt-4', 'n': 1, 'stop': ['\\nObservation'], 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.7}}\n",

       "Bacteriophage Phi X 174 has historically been significant in the field of DNA sequencing and bacteriophage treatments. Its genome is relatively small and has been extensively studied as a model organism, which has contributed to advances in nanopore sequencing technology. This technology can sequence reads of Phi X 174 up to 4,500 bases in length that can be unambiguously aligned to the Phi X 174 reference genome. This has proven useful for hybrid genome assembly and polymorphism detection [1]. Moreover, in the context of bacteriophage treatments, coinfections modeling that involve Phi X 174 have been analyzed. These studies show how coinfection affects the dose of bacteriophages needed to eliminate bacteria and the velocity of convergence to the bacteria-free equilibrium [2]. Recent advances in DNA sequencing have opened prospects to make whole-genome analysis rapid and reliable, with Phi X 174 being used in experimental genome assembly tasks using quantum and quantum-inspired optimization techniques [3].\n",
